# Kubernetes-Cluster-Architecture
Welcome to the Kubernetes Cluster Architecture - Visualized repository! ðŸš€

This repo is designed to help you understand how a Kubernetes cluster works internally â€” from the moment you deploy a Pod to how networking, scheduling, and control flow happen behind the scenes.

##From kubectl apply to a Running Pod (Clear Step-by-Step)

Below is a breakdown of the full lifecycle of a Pod â€” showing how each component in the Kubernetes architecture gets involved step-by-step.

## Step 1: User Submits a Pod

``` kubectl apply -f sample-pod.yaml ```

- The user sends a YAML definition of a Pod to the cluster.
- This request is sent to the API server over HTTPS.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ```
